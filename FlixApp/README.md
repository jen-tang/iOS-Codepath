### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

This app took way longer than I thought it would. I had to scrap and redo this project 3 times. The first time was because I initialized the project with the wrong language, Objective C instead of Swift.
The second time was because I'm running a newer version of Xcode, so I couldnt find the assistant editor button, so I did my IBOutlets through two tabs. I found out the hard way that this does not work, but I removed all the connections and had trouble putting it back together. So, I had to restart on to the 3rd version.
The third version I figured everything out though :D
